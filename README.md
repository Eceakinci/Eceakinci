# Hi, I'm Ece 👋

I am a former **front-end** developer now diving into **AI** and **data science**.
Over time, I’ve become especially comfortable working with JavaScript
frameworks like **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **jQuery** as well as styling tools such as **Sass** and **Tailwind CSS.**

Currently, I’m studying for my Master’s in **Artificial Intelligence** at Brandenburg University of Technology,
where I’m focusing on **data science**, **Python**, **R**, and **machine learning**.

- 🔭 I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at BTU.

- 🌱 Currently developing a web scraper using Python, pandas, numpy, and Playwright.
